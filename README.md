# Inbox

The Udemy course Ethereum &amp; Solidity: A Complete Developer's Guide is excellent but the code and versioning is deprecated.

This is the updated version of Inbox smart contract application in the Udemy course Ethereum &amp; Solidity: A Complete Developer's Guide. UP TO DATE with Solidity 0.5.2 and truffle-hd-wallet-provider 0.0.3.

Make sure you add your own Metamask Mnemonic and your Infura Rinkeby access token in your `HDWalletProvider` constructor in `deploy.js`.
